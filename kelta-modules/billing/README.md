# Kelta Billing Module

Stripe-backed portal billing, packaged as a **runtime-installable Kelta module**: one signed JAR
plus its manifest, uploaded into a tenant with no platform recompile or redeploy.

It is the reference implementation for the module SPI — the thing that proves a customer could
ship functionality Kelta never anticipated. Read it alongside
[`.claude/docs/playbooks.md`](../../.claude/docs/playbooks.md) → *Ship a runtime-installable module*.

## What is in the one JAR

| Piece | How it reaches the platform |
|-------|-----------------------------|
| `billing_plans`, `billing_customers`, `billing_subscriptions`, `billing_passes`, `billing_entitlement_rules` | Declared in `kelta-module.json` → created at install through the standard collection API |
| `billing:create-checkout-session` | `ActionHandler`, invoked as a flow action |
| `billing:create-portal-session` | `ActionHandler` — opens Stripe's billing portal for the calling member |
| `billing:resolve-entitlements` | `ActionHandler` — replaces `GET /api/billing/me`; a module cannot contribute a controller |
| `billing:expire-passes` | `ActionHandler` — schedule with a scheduled flow; **a module has no scheduler** |
| `billing:stripe-webhook` | `ActionHandler`, dispatched by `POST /api/modules/webhooks/{tenantId}/kelta-billing` |
| Per-member quotas | `MemberEntitlementQuotaHook`, a wildcard `BeforeSaveHook` driven by `billing_entitlement_rules` |
| Billing Plans widget | `static/ui-bundle.js`, served by `GET /api/modules/kelta-billing/ui-bundle.js` |

## Deliberate differences from the compiled-in implementation

These are not oversights. Each is a platform constraint a module cannot escape, and each changes
behaviour in a way an operator should know about.

| Compiled-in | This module | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `EntitlementServiceImpl` caches per member (Caffeine) and invalidates fleet-wide over NATS | `EntitlementResolver` **does not cache** | A module cannot subscribe to NATS, so a cache it held could not be invalidated when a webhook on another pod changed a subscription. A stale entitlement is worse than a slower one. |
| `BillingPassExpirySweep` is a Spring `@Scheduled` bean | `billing:expire-passes` action, scheduled by a flow | A module is not a Spring bean and has no scheduler. Expiry is read-time anyway, so a sweep that never runs cannot over-entitle anyone. |
| Sweep claims rows `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` | No claim | A module writes through `QueryEngine` and cannot express one. Two pods sweeping concurrently flip the same row to the same terminal value — harmless. |
| Quota hook reads `X-User-Type` to exempt internal staff | **Skips `appliesTo=PORTAL` rules** (logged once) | Neither `jakarta.servlet` nor `org.springframework` is on a module's classpath, so a module cannot read the actor tier. Use `appliesTo=ALL` for rules that must hold for every actor. |
| Webhook claims each event id in a row sharing the mutation's transaction | Converges instead | See *Known limitations* below. |

## Build

```bash
mvn -f kelta-modules/billing/pom.xml package
```

Produces `target/kelta-module-billing-1.0.0.jar`. Install it through the admin UI's **Modules**
page, or `POST /api/modules/install-jar` with the JAR, `kelta-module.json`, and a detached
signature when the tenant has a signing key configured.

**This project is deliberately outside the `kelta-platform` Maven reactor and has no parent pom.**
Wiring it in would ship it with the platform and quietly undo the point of the exercise. Its
`runtime-core` / `runtime-module-integration` dependencies are `provided` because both load from
the platform classloader at runtime; bundling them would put a second copy of the runtime model in
the JAR and every cast to a platform type would fail.

## Tenant setup

1. Create a credential of type **`stripe`** named `stripe`, holding:
   - `secretKey` — `sk_…` or `rk_…`
   - `webhookSecret` — `whsec_…` (the endpoint signing secret)
   - `allowedReturnOrigins` — the origins checkout may return a member to
2. Point a Stripe webhook endpoint at
   `https://<tenant-host>/api/modules/webhooks/<tenantId>/kelta-billing`, subscribed to
   `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.created|updated|deleted`.
3. Create `billing_plans` rows. `kind` is `SUBSCRIPTION`, `ONE_TIME`, or `DEFAULT` (the free
   baseline — not purchasable). `stripePriceId` must match the Stripe price.

## Security notes

- **The webhook route is unauthenticated and the platform verifies nothing.** This module is the
  trust anchor: `ProcessStripeWebhookActionHandler` resolves the tenant's own credential and checks
  the HMAC over the **raw** body before parsing it. Re-serializing the body would change the bytes
  the signature covers.
- **Return URLs are matched on scheme + host + port**, never as a string prefix, and fail closed
  when no origins are configured — otherwise `https://good.example.com` would authorize
  `https://good.example.com.evil.test`.
- **The UI bundle runs same-origin** with the admin session's full DOM and cookie access. The JAR
  signature verified at install and re-verified on read is the entire trust model; there is no
  browser-side isolation.
- Stripe's own error messages are logged, never returned to a caller — they can name account
  internals. Money is never computed here: amounts, proration, tax, dunning, and retries all stay
  with Stripe, and these collections hold ids and coarse state only.

## Known limitations (versus the compiled-in implementation this replaces)

These are real gaps, not oversights — record them before relying on this in production:

- **Webhook idempotency is weaker.** The compiled-in version claims each event id in a row that
  shares one transaction with the mutation, so a failure rolls the claim back and Stripe's retry
  genuinely re-runs. A module writes through `QueryEngine` and has no transaction of its own, so
  this relies on convergence instead: a pass is granted once per checkout session, and a
  subscription is upserted by its Stripe id. Replaying converges; it does not duplicate. A partial
  failure mid-event can still leave one write applied and another not.
- **Live verification is owed.** Nothing here has run against real Stripe keys or a live tenant.
  The compiled-in billing code must stay in place until it has. The runbook for that is
  [`VERIFICATION.md`](VERIFICATION.md) — note especially that a signature failure installs **inert
  stub handlers while still reporting ACTIVE**, so "installed and ACTIVE" is not evidence of
  anything.
- The behavioural differences in the table above are permanent given the module boundary — decide
  they are acceptable for your tenant before cutting over, particularly the **`appliesTo=PORTAL`
  quota rules being skipped**, which silently enforces nothing where the compiled-in version
  enforced a member cap.
