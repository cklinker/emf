 * Resolves what a member is entitled to — the platform-defined port a billing module implements so

 * <p>Published by a module through {@code KeltaModule.getServices()} and resolved per call from
 * {@link ModuleServiceRegistry}. When no installed module publishes one, callers keep whatever
 * compiled-in behaviour they already had, so the port's existence changes nothing on its own.
 *
 * <p><b>The caller binds the tenant.</b> {@code tenantId} is passed explicitly and the platform
 * establishes {@code TenantContext} (id <i>and</i> slug) around the call, because an implementation
 * that reads its data through the query engine resolves the tenant's schema from the
 * <b>slug</b> — a module has no way to look one up, and a null slug silently reads the public
 * schema instead of the tenant's.
 *
 * <p>Implementations must be safe to call concurrently and must not cache across tenants.
