 * Binding scope + the `getPath` dot/`[n]` walker, and the resolver seam.

 * In slice 2a `resolveBindings` was an identity no-op declared here. Slice 2d moves the REAL resolver
 * into {@link ./resolveBindings} and this module RE-EXPORTS it, so the existing `renderTree.tsx` import
 * (`{ resolveBindings, BindingScope }` from this file) keeps working with an unchanged signature. The
 * resolved-node invariant (parent spec) still holds: props handed to a widget's `Render` are always
 * already resolved; descriptors must not resolve again (the sole exception is `list`/`repeater`, which
 * re-resolves its children under each per-row `item` scope).
