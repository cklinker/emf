/**
 * Wildcard after-delete hook that cascades attachment cleanup when a record is removed.
 *
 * <p>When any record is deleted, this hook removes the record's
 * {@code file_attachment} rows and deletes their underlying S3 objects so storage
 * is not orphaned. It runs late (order {@code 200}) so it executes after other
 * after-delete side effects.
 *
 * <p>Direct deletes of attachment records are handled by
 * {@code AttachmentUploadController#deleteAttachment}, not this hook: {@code afterDelete}
 * does not provide the deleted row, so the storage key cannot be recovered after the
 * fact. This hook covers the <em>parent</em> record case, where the
 * {@code file_attachment} rows still exist at delete time and can be looked up by
 * {@code record_id}. The {@code attachments} collection is therefore skipped here.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
