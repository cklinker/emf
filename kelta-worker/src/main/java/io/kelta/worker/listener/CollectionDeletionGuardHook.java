/**
 * Delete guard and storage-cleanup hook for the {@code collections} system collection.
 *
 * <p>V181 gave the 15 child FKs on {@code collection(id)} an {@code ON DELETE CASCADE}
 * (or {@code SET NULL}), which is what finally made a used collection deletable at all —
 * before it, the first record write created a {@code field_history} row and Postgres
 * rejected every subsequent delete with 23503. That cascade has two consequences this
 * hook exists to handle:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Blast radius.</b> The broken FK was accidentally acting as a safety net. Now a
 *       single {@code DELETE /api/collections/{id}} destroys attachments, layouts, reports,
 *       validation rules, field history and record versions. So a delete that would destroy
 *       children is rejected with a 400 (a hook validation error) naming the counts unless
 *       the caller opts in with {@code ?force=true}.</li>
 *   <li><b>Orphaned S3 objects.</b> {@code file_attachment} and {@code bulk_job} carry
 *       storage keys. A database-level cascade removes the rows and would leak every
 *       underlying object silently. The keys are therefore collected and deleted here in
 *       {@link #beforeDelete}, because once the cascade fires the keys are unrecoverable —
 *       the same constraint documented on {@link AttachmentCleanupHook}, which covers the
 *       parent-<em>record</em> case and never sees a collection delete.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Calls with no HTTP request context (flows, NATS listeners, schedulers, tests) cannot
 * pass {@code force}. They are treated as <b>not</b> forced, so an automated caller can
 * never destroy authored metadata by accident; such a delete fails closed with the same 400.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
